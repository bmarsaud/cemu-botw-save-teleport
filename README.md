# cemu-botw-save-teleport

A Node.js utility modifying the most recent CEMU savegame of "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" by changing the player position to a defined one. The older position will be displayed for an eventual future use.

This script uses the logic of [savegame-editors](https://github.com/marcrobledo/savegame-editors) project to load and edit the game save.

## Why ?
It's a workaround if your game is stuck on the loading screen at a certain location.

Changing the player location in the game save will let the game load. Once loaded you can go back to your previous location.
